# implementation_of_the_Gauss_method
This repository implements several modifications of the Gaussian method, namely: the Gaussian method of sequential elimination by columns, the Gaussian method of optimal elimination of unknowns and the Gauss-Jordan method. Each of these methods is presented in two copies: the first algorithm uses classic Python lists, and the second implements the same algorithm, but through lists whose indexing starts from 1 rather than 0. This makes it easier and more familiar to work with a matrix, from a mathematical point of view, it is more convenient to understand the operation of the algorithm and change it as necessary.
You can also solve differential equations using the Euler method or the Runge-Kutta method. Implemented Euler's method for electron second order, Runge-Kutta method for initial second order and solution of systems of differential equations.
The following approximate methods are supported for solving systems of nonlinear equations: the bisection method, the chord method and the tangent method.
There are functions for finding the approximate value of some specific elementary functions, using two methods: Chebyshev and iterations.
